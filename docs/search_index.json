When concluding 2020, we find that the global pandemic has induced several unprecedent consequences, and the stock market instability is among the list. In March, we have seen circuit breakers triggered 4 times in a week. Analysts said the 2020 stock market crash and the following global economic recession is the worst since the Great Depression. 1.2 Research Topic As the governments around the world have issued lockdown orders, people are forced to stay at home and do everything virtually. We realize that, if there is only one type of company that stands alone in this Coronavirus crash, it is technology companies. Thus, in this project, we purpose the main research question: how did companies in the tech industry perform during the Covid-19 period? 1.3 Project Roadmap In particular, we have picked the 5 most representative types of tech companies including Streaming, E-commerce, Entertainment (Gaming), Work-From-Home, and integrated companies, i.e. the giants. In the following pages, we will evaluate the companies performances mainly based on three measurements. First, we look at the companies behave on the stock market. Moreover, we introduce the measurement Confidence Index to evaluate investor confidence in the market. Finally, we also take the companies quarterly revenue into account. Based on the three measurements described above, we hope our work would shed some light for those who look back at this unprecedented year.

The code below is an example of how data is scraped using Netflix. Other data gathering methods considered are grabbing data directly from each companys financial report as well as copy and paste data from Yahoo Finance. However, I choose to scrap the data because it is the easiest way to download data for multiple companies and all the data has been validated with the companys public financial report or Yahoo Finance to prevent errors. Some issue with the data now is that both variables are in character type and we would like the first to be date variable and second to be numerical. This problem will be handled in Data transformation part. 2.1.1 Example for extracting Netflix quarterly revenue ## Date Revenue ## 1 2020-09-30 $6,436 ## 2 2020-06-30 $6,148 ## 3 2020-03-31 $5,768 ## 4 2019-12-31 $5,467 ## 5 2019-09-30 $5,245 ## 6 2019-06-30 $4,923 ## 7 2019-03-31 $4,521 ## 8 2018-12-31 $4,187 ## 9 2018-09-30 $3,999 ## 10 2018-06-30 $3,907 2.2 Investors confidence index Data collection for individual confidence index is supported by Andrew Redleaf of Lynne and Andrew Redleaf Foundation(previously Whitebox advisors). There are two samples that include in the data: a sample of wealthy individual investors, and a sample of institutional investors. In the years of our interests, the samples of both individual and institutional investors are purchased from InfoUSA( Data Axle: a reputable provider of data). The datasets have the U.S. institutional and individual index values from 12/2018 to 10/2020. The One-Year Confidence index is the percentage of respondents giving a number strictly greater than 0 for in one year.Index values are in numeric forms ranging from 0 to 100, and they are reported monthly. The potential bias of data comes from two parts. Firstly, the surveys which are randomly sampled to generate datasets conducted at six-month intervals. Thus, the index value of current month is the average of monthly surveys in the past six months. It can be observed from the dataset that the deviation of index values among months is small due to the averaging effect, and it may cause bias when we explore the relationship of stock market and confidence index values. Moreover, the question in the survey is worded to mention the possibilities that the respondent could predict a downturn. Participants tend to have more passive responses than those who receive more optimistically worded questions. Thus, confidence index values in general is a subjective metric. https://som.yale.edu/faculty-research-centers/centers-initiatives/international-center-for-finance/data/stock-market-confidence-indices/united-states-stock-market-confidence-indices 2.3 Daily stock price For each of the companies we choosed, the historical stock price data can be quickly loaded using getSymbols function in quantmod package. Using yahoo as the sourcing method, we load the past daily stock prices including Open price, High price, Low price, Close price, Volume and Adjusted price from January 1, 2020 to December 11, 2020.

Then we would like to merge the tables by date, one column for each table. The import process is in quarterly_rev_import.rmd. Notice that Zoom, Cisco Systems, and 8*8, inc. has different quarterly system from other companies, we will not discuss them here. ## Date netflix disney amazon att roku overstock blue_apron wayfair etsy ## 1 2018-12-31 4187 15303 72383 47993 276 453 141 2014 200 ## 2 2019-03-31 4521 14922 59700 44827 207 368 142 1945 169 ## 3 2019-06-30 4923 20262 63404 44957 250 374 119 2343 181 ## 4 2019-09-30 5245 19120 69981 44588 261 347 99 2305 198 ## 5 2019-12-31 5467 20858 87437 46821 411 371 94 2533 270 ## 6 2020-03-31 5768 18009 75452 42779 321 352 102 2330 228 ## 7 2020-06-30 6148 11779 88912 40950 356 783 131 4305 429 ## 8 2020-09-30 6436 14742 96145 42340 452 732 112 3840 451 ## farfetch ea sciplay ttwo atvi eght rng msft goog twtr fb aapl ## 1 196 1289 NA 1249 2382 90 189 32471 39276 909 16914 84310 ## 2 174 1238 118 539 1825 94 201 30571 36339 787 15077 58015 ## 3 209 1209 118 540 1396 97 215 33717 38944 841 16886 53809 ## 4 639 1348 116 858 1282 110 233 33055 40499 824 17652 64040 ## 5 -1 1593 113 930 1986 119 253 36906 46075 1007 21082 91819 ## 6 331 1387 118 761 1788 121 268 35021 41159 808 17737 58313 ## 7 365 1459 166 831 1932 122 278 38033 38297 683 18687 59685 ## 8 1134 1151 151 841 1954 129 304 37154 46173 936 21470 64698 3.2 Daily Stock Price For each stock, in getSymbols function, we defined parameters like stock symbol, start date and end date (in our case is January 1, 2020 to December 11, 2020). The stock data will be automatically loaded as an xts (Extensible Time Series) object and assigned to a dataset using the stock symbol as the name. To convert the data to dataframe structure, we used as.data.frame(get(stock_index)) to change the structure. Then, we added Date column and Stock Index column and filtered the data to only keep the closing price. With a for-loop, we downloaded the closing price of each stock one by one and appended them together in one dataframe. To scale the data, each closing price value is divided by the value of first date (January 2, 2020) for that stock and multiplied by 100. 3.3 Investors confidence index For confidence index data, there is a csv file on the website which is free to download. We can easily use read.csv function in R to read in the data. Drop the standard error columns, and rename two  index values columns to differentiate between institutional category and individual category. Moreover, the Date column needs to be formatted in a way that corresponds with other two data source. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values LogMeIn (LOGM)s stock price contains missing values. The closing prices from September 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 are missing. They are a contiguous piece of time series. We plan to keep them for now. Zoom, Cisco Systems, and 8 \\(\\times\\) 8 has different definition of quarter from other companies, thus we will not discuss their quarterly revenue in this project. There are no missing values involved in other parts. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Question 1: How did tech companies behave in stock market under the Covid-19 pandemic? 5.2 Question 2: How do tech companies perform with respect to other measurements?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Question 1: How did tech companies behave in stock market under the Covid-19 pandemic? In this part, we created line charts of stock price, quarterly revenue and quarterly revenues year-on-year growth for companies from different technology industries. Within each industry, using daily stock closing price as the main merit, together with the quarterly revenue and business models for different companies, we compared and analyzed companies performance under the Covid-19 pandemic and identified a performace pattern for each industry. To begin with, note that every stock price line chart below shows that there is a sudden drop for each line in between February and April, which means that every companys stock price experienced some devastating crashes between the end of February and the begining of April. This is due to the 2020 stock market crash, also referred to as the Coronavirus Crash. It was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on February 20 and ended on April 7. The crash signalled the beginning of the Covid-19 recession. And our focus is analyzing companies performace after that crash point and the start of Covid-19 pandemic. To facilitate our analysis, we scaled the stock closing price to make each stocks closing price start at 100 on January 2. 5.1.1 Streaming service - Companies with mature and diversified online businesses performed strongly, while companies still in transition to online business felt under attack. With restriction on traveling and social-distancing measures in place, online streaming service are witnessing a surge in users. From the stock price line plot, Netflix and Roku both staged a strong recovery from the breakdown in March and continued to grow strongly since then, while Disney and AT&amp;T remained sluggish after March for a long time. Netflix dazzled investors with its robust growth in subscribers and revenue. The stable growth of its stock and revenue can be attributted to the Covid-19 pandemic, which boosted the usage of streaming media services as more people stayed home. Together with Netflixs massive base of subscribers shaped over a long period of time, the economies of scale also helped Netflix gain a clear advantage over other competitors. Roku shows an more explosive growth in stock price in the past 6 months. While both occupy a significant portion of the streaming TV market, Roku and Netflix are two fundamentally different companies. Netflix operates as a subscription service while Rokus business is based on streaming players and free content supported by ad-revenue. Besides the growing user base, Rokus higher ad revenue also helped boost the stock price and the overall revenue. Things become different for Disney and AT&amp;T, whose businesses are not limited to streaming service. AT&amp;T mainly provids wireless, wireline, and pay TV services. After AT&amp;T bought Time Warner two years ago, it began to plan its new streaming media ecosystem. However, its wireless business struggled in the first half of the year as the Covid-19 crisis shut down retailers, and the WarnerMedia group faced closed theaters and postponed movies. Similarly, apart from streaming service, a large part of Disneys revenue comes from its parks and resorts. Because of the theme park closures and the slowdown in the tourism sector during the pandemic, COVID-19 had brought a continuous loss in Disneys quarterly revenues from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q2. But there were a few bright spots. The newly launched Disney Plus, its Netflix challenger, attracted millions of subscribers since launching and made its stock and revenue get a lift in the past few months. 5.1.2 Entertainment (Gaming) - Gaming companies took the opportunity and got rich together. Companies from gaming industry generally have similar performance to Netflix and Roku, that is to say, quick bounce-back from March, sustainable and strong growth. This is accordant with peoples favor and engagement in video gaming during the pandemic, and video gaming companies new products catered to appeal to consumers. For many people, Covid-19 lockdowns quickly increased the number of hours spent in front of screens and also inspired millions to try new digital activities. With school and office closures, work furloughs, and canceled travel plans, more people are playing video games and more are upgrading their gaming relationships from casual to committed. Taking this opportunity, gaming companies not only kept launching new game products from simple mobile games to immersive multiplayer experiences, but also implemented sophisticated marketing campaigns tailored to a whole new audience. As a result, their stock price kept growing steadily after the breakout of the pandemic. But when people begin returning to school and work schedules, will video games maintain their share of entertainment time? Since August, the stock price of most companies displays a slower pace of growth and enter a shock period. Together with their revenue drop in 2020 Q3, it seems that, from game studios and publishers to console makers, they are still seeking a way to convert more casual gamers into long-term customers. 5.1.3 Ecommerce - They were all benefited from the same pandemic but different profit sources. Ecommerce companies stock prices have been steadily increasing for almost the whole year. After the crash in March, they quickly regained their previous values, climbed to a higher level than before and stay in the high level until today. Their stock prices have been major beneficiaries of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has served as a catalyst for ecommerce growth in the US as consumers shifted to online shopping to social distance and avoid crowded stores. While the steady performance of Amazon is not surprising under the accelerated growth of Amazons Prime membership base and Amazons accelerated adoption of cloud services, the other relatively small companies also found their ways of earning money. Etsy has directly benefited from the sale of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. And more surprisingly, Overstock stock has been on fire this year. As shown in the revnue plot, the pandemic has generated a business boom for Overstock and has improved its revenue. The pandemic is driving households to spend more on home furnishing items. Also, home furnishing purchases have shifted more to online purchases, which bodes well for Overstock, whose focus is the online home furnishing sales. In addition, Overstock has much cheaper stock price, which is particularly attractive for a number of small investors. 5.1.4 Videoconferencing - Burgeoning industry fueled by pandemic, Zoom is the big winner. Cloud services are in higher demand than ever. Videoconferencing and remote collaboration use are at all-time highs as companies scramble to keep employees productive and schools transition to online remote learning. Zoom stock showed waves of explosive growth this year, as its video conferencing software became an indispensable tool for people working and learning from home through Covid-19. It has emerged as the video conferencing platform of choice through the pandemic, mainly becauce of its easy user interface, simple sign-up process and free services. But recently since September, there has been some news like physical economy is likely to open up further through 2021, with many developed countries likely to have access to a highly effective Covid-19 vaccine starting from the next spring. This has put the brakes on Zooms growth and made it enter to a shock period. However, it will take some time for people to get vaccinated. Moreover, as companies look to cut costs, and give employees more flexibility, the trend of working from home appears to be here to stay even after the pandemic ends in the future. This should ensure that demand for videoconferencing product and the stock price holds up for now. 5.1.5 Tech Giants - Traditional giants put up a solid performance and they are untouchable. Not only have stocks of tech giants played a crucial role in stock markets swift recovery following the Covid-19-induced mini-crash in March, the pandemic has turned them into a sanctuary for investors since then. And this steady and sustainable performance of tech giants is justifiable, given that these companies are highly profitable and their business models are widely diversified and ideally suited to the pandemic. While other companies saw revenue collapse as populations were ordered to stay at home, the tech giants enjoyed a rush of demand. When locked at home, people go shopping on Amazon, play with their iPhones, google stuff, contact friends on Facebook and Twitter, stream movies on Netflix or hold meetings with colleagues on Microsoft Teams.The strong performance of tech giants stock is a epitome of the strong momentum of the whole tech industry for the past year. 5.1.6 Summary To sum up, tech companies with mature online business have gained traction over the past few months as the coronavirus pandemic locked most people indoors, but different companies from different industries have different survival mechanisms specifically. Looking to the future, when people begin returning to school and work schedules after the pandemic, will those companies dramatically fueled by Covid-19 maintain their price values and shape up their truely sustainable business models? 5.2 Question 2: How do tech companies perform with respect to other measurements? In the second part, firstly, we created stock line chart that overlays CI bar chart across different tech services provider to explore the potential correlation between investors stock CI and stock closing price. Moreover, parallel coordinates plots were created to explore the potential correlations between Quarterly CI and companies quarterly revenue. By looking at the parallel coordinates plots, we mainly focus on comparing the companies performance with itself in pre and post-COVID 19 situations. 5.2.1 Confidence Index and Stock Closing Price(Standardized) Streaming Services As shown in the plot, despite of decreasing confidence index, stock price of industry-leading streaming-service companies like Netflix and Roku kept an increasing trend, which outperforms investors expectation of the stock market. At the same time, the stock performance of emerging streaming-service companies like Disney and AT&amp;T matches the changes of investors confidence of stock market. E-commerce As shown in the plot, the performances of online-shopping companies in the stock market matches investors expectation. Entertainment/Gaming Stock price of Entertainment companies had overall increasing tendency which outperforms investors expectation of stock market. Videoconferencing Stock of price of Zoom outperforms investors expectation since April. However, the performance of other companies with similar services and certain customer groups in the stock market is about the same as investors expectation. Tech Giants The stock markets performance of these giant multi-national tech companies had strong increasing trend since April, which is way over investors expectation potentially due to the uniqueness of services that they provide,and supports from large amount of users. 5.2.2 Result conclusion: In terms of stock closing price, performances of most of tech companies were over investors expectation even when investors stock market confidence was low. Moreover, for other tech companies which had emerging service line or didnt have unsubstitutable services/products, their overall stock market performance matched the changes of CI. 5.2.3 Quarterly Confidence Index and Quarterly Revenue Streaming Services: Parallel Coordinates for Quarterly Confidence Index and Companies Revenue Before COVID-19, there is a positive correlation between investors confidence level and revenue of streaming companies. Compared to 1st quarter of 2019, second quarter of 2019s CI increased, and the revenue for streaming companies increased as well. After COVID-19,there is a negative correlation between investors confidence level and revenue of streaming companies. For instance, compared to 2020 second quarters CI, the 2020 3rd quarters CI decreased but the revenue of the 3rd quarter across different streaming companies increased. E-Commerce: Parallel Coordinates for Quarterly Confidence Index and Companies Revenue Both before and after COVID-19, there is a negative correlation between investors expectation of stock market and revenue of online-shopping companies. Before COVID-19, compared to CI of 2019 1st quarter , second quarter of 2019s CI increased but the revenue is less than that of the 1st quarter.After COVID-19, for example, although the CI of 2020 3rd quarter decreased compared with that of 2020 second quarter, the revenue of companies like Farfetch, Amazon and Etsy increased as well. Entertainment/Gaming Parallel Coordinates for Quarterly Confidence Index and Companies Revenue Before COVID-19, there is a positive correlation between investors confidence level and revenue of streaming companies. Compared to 4th quarter of 2018, second quarter of 2019s CI increased, and the revenue of two gaming companies increased as well. After COVID-19,there is a negative correlation between investors confidence level and revenue of streaming companies. For instance, compared to 2020 second quarters CI, the 2020 3rd quarters CI decreased but the revenue of the 3rd quarter across two gaming companies shown increased. Video-conferencing Parallel Coordinates for Quarterly Confidence Index and Companies Revenue Before COVID-19, there is a positive correlation between investors confidence level and revenue of WFH companies. For example, Compared to 1st quarter of 2019, second quarter of 2019s CI increased, and the revenue increased as well. After COVID-19,there is a negative correlation between investors confidence level and revenue of WFH companies. For instance, compared to 2020 second quarters CI, the 2020 3rd quarters CI decreased but the revenue of the 3rd quarter for two WFH companies increased. Tech Giants Parallel Coordinates for Quarterly Confidence Index and Companies Revenue Before COVID-19, there is a positive correlation between investors confidence level and revenue of streaming companies. From 2018 4th Q to 2019 1st Q confidence index increased but revenue of companies increased as well. After COVID-19,there is a negative correlation between investors confidence level and revenue of streaming companies. For instance, from 2020 2nd Q to 2020 3rd Q, confidence index increased but the revenue dropped dramatically across all companies on the plot. 5.2.4 Result conclusion: Except E-Commerce companies, quarterly revenue of all other type of tech companies mentioned above seems to have positive correlation with quarterly CI before COVID-19. However, a negative correlation between quarterly revenue and quarterly CI was observed after the outbreak of COVID-19. As for E-Commerce companies, there seems to be a negative correlation between quarterly revenue and quarterly CI both before and after COVID-19.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion This reports explores several aspects of tech companies performances during COVID-19 period. By looking at the three measurements introduced in the project, we have found that different sub-industries in technology behave distinctly. We think this is due to the nature of each sub-industries. For example, we think video game industry and online streaming are born to be internet companies and their performances soar during the global pandemic. On the other hand, we believe that emerging sectors such as online shopping and work-from-home that are still within the transition from traditional industry to technology industry. Currently, these sectors show a winner-take-all pattern as all companies provide interchangeable services. By our analysis of E-Commerce and Video-conference, we believe that even though the COVID-19 creates an unprecedent opportunity for them, these companies need to re-think about their diverse sources of growth to better catch the chance. All in all, by looking at the integrated companies and the general market trends provided by the Confidence Index, we consider that in general tech companies out-performed the whole market during COVID-19 despite the global recession. In the future, we would like to keep tracking how technology companies behave in long run after the pandemic crash. Due to the limited data we collected, the trends we described in this project may be biased. If we have more data available in long term, we may be able to give a more decisive conclusion. "]]
