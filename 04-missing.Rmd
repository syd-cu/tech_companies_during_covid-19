# Missing values
LogMeIn (LOGM)'s stock price contains missing values. The closing prices from September 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 are missing. They are a contiguous piece of time series. We plan to keep them for now.

\n Zoom, Cisco Systems, and 8 $\times$ 8 has different definition of quarter from other companies, thus we will not discuss their quarterly revenue in this project. 

\n There are no missing values involved in other parts.
