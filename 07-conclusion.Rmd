# Conclusion

This reports explores several aspects of tech companies performances during COVID-19 period. By looking at the three measurements introduced in the project, we have found that different sub-industries in technology behave distinctly. We think this is due to the nature of each sub-industries. For example, we think video game industry and online streaming are born to be internet companies and their performances soar during the global pandemic. 

\n On the other hand, we believe that emerging sectors such as online shopping and work-from-home that are still within the transition from traditional industry to technology industry. Currently, these sectors show a winner-take-all pattern as all companies provide interchangeable services. By our analysis of E-Commerce and Video-conference, we believe that even though the COVID-19 creates an unprecedent opportunity for them, these companies need to re-think about their diverse sources of growth to better catch the chance.  

\n All in all, by looking at the integrated companies and the general market trends provided by the Confidence Index, we consider that in general tech companies out-performed the whole market during COVID-19 despite the global recession. 

\n In the future, we would like to keep tracking how technology companies behave in long run after the pandemic crash. Due to the limited data we collected, the trends we described in this project may be biased. If we have more data available in long term, we may be able to give a more decisive conclusion.
